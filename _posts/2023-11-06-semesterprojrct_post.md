## Introduction
In this insightful exploration, we delve into the dynamic world of finance and technology, with a focus on Tesla, a company emblematic of groundbreaking innovation and occasional controversy. This project transcends the boundaries of a typical academic exercise, venturing into a real-world examination of how significant events associated with a high-profile company like Tesla can sway investor sentiment and shape market dynamics.

## Question
The genesis of this project was sparked by a personal connection â€“ a friend contemplating the purchase of a Tesla. This decision brought to the forefront questions not only about the car's technological prowess but also about the company's standing in the tumultuous world of the stock market. Driven by this curiosity, we set out to investigate how Tesla, a titan in both the high-tech and automotive industries, fares when its vehicles are involved in fatalities. How do these incidents impact Tesla's stock prices? 


## Data

The cornerstone of our project is a meticulously orchestrated data collection process, where accuracy and ethical sourcing stood as our guiding principles:

##### Stock Price Data:
Our journey commenced with the collection of Tesla's historical stock prices, utilizing a combination of financial databases and stock market APIs. This dataset is pivotal, providing the framework to trace Tesla's stock price trends against a timeline of events.

##### Death Data Collection:
Our pursuit of accurate and ethically sourced data led us to a thorough exploration of various platforms. The quest for data that was both reliable and publicly permissible steered us to Kaggle. On this platform, we discovered a dataset that meticulously chronicled incidents involving Tesla vehicles that resulted in fatalities. This dataset includes precise details on the date, location, model involved, crash descriptions, fatalities, and whether Autopilot was engaged, providing an in-depth view of each incident.

##### Data Integration:
The essence of our study lies in the sophisticated process of merging the stock data with the incident data. By aligning the dates of specific events with Tesla's stock price movements, our goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that provide a deeper understanding of the market's reaction to these incidents.

## Ethical Considerations

Our approach to analyzing Tesla's stock performance in relation to reported fatalities is guided by a steadfast commitment to ethical integrity, encompassing the following key areas:



##### Respect for Privacy:
In dealing with data that encompasses real-life incidents, we are acutely conscious of the sensitive nature of personal information. We have ensured that all personal details related to the incidents are handled with the utmost confidentiality and sensitivity. Our analysis focuses on aggregate data trends rather than individual cases, thereby safeguarding personal privacy while still providing meaningful insights.


##### Objectivity:
Objectivity is the cornerstone of our analytical framework. We are dedicated to maintaining an unbiased perspective throughout our study. While our analysis may shed light on correlations between Tesla's stock performance and specific incidents, we are careful to present our findings in a way that does not unjustly influence public opinion about Tesla or the individuals involved in these incidents. Our goal is to provide a clear, data-driven perspective, free from personal biases or preconceived notions about the company or its products.


##### Data Integrity
Upholding data integrity is crucial to our project's credibility. We have meticulously selected our data sources for their reliability and accuracy. Throughout our analysis, we remain transparent about the origins of our data and openly acknowledge any limitations or potential biases inherent in our data sources. We have made concerted efforts to ensure that the data underpinning our analysis is robust, accurately reflecting the trends and patterns we report.



## Conclusion

This project presents a unique intersection of data analysis, financial market dynamics, and societal impact. Through our exploration, we aim not only to understand the interplay between corporate events and stock performance but also to contribute thoughtfully to the discourse on automotive safety and technological advancement. Our findings have the potential to offer valuable insights into investor behavior, corporate responsibility, and public perception, particularly in the realm of cutting-edge technology and its implications.
