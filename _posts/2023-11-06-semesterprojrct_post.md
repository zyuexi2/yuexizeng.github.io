## Introduction
In this insightful exploration, we delve into the dynamic world of finance and technology, with a focus on Tesla, a company emblematic of groundbreaking innovation and occasional controversy. This project transcends the boundaries of a typical academic exercise, venturing into a real-world examination of how significant events associated with a high-profile company like Tesla can sway investor sentiment and shape market dynamics.


## Question
The genesis of this project was sparked by a personal connection â€“ a friend contemplating the purchase of a Tesla. This decision brought to the forefront questions not only about the car's technological prowess but also about the company's standing in the tumultuous world of the stock market. Driven by this curiosity, we set out to investigate how Tesla, a titan in both the high-tech and automotive industries, fares when its vehicles are involved in fatalities. How do these incidents impact Tesla's stock prices? 


## Data

The cornerstone of our project is a meticulously orchestrated data collection process, where accuracy and ethical sourcing stood as our guiding principles:

Stock Price Data: Our journey commenced with the collection of Tesla's historical stock prices, utilizing a combination of financial databases and stock market APIs. This dataset is pivotal, providing the framework to trace Tesla's stock price trends against a timeline of events.

Death Data Collection: Our pursuit of accurate and ethically sourced data led us to a thorough exploration of various platforms. The quest for data that was both reliable and publicly permissible steered us to Kaggle. On this platform, we discovered a dataset that meticulously chronicled incidents involving Tesla vehicles that resulted in fatalities. This dataset includes precise details on the date, location, model involved, crash descriptions, fatalities, and whether Autopilot was engaged, providing an in-depth view of each incident.

Data Integration: The essence of our study lies in the sophisticated process of merging the stock data with the incident data. By aligning the dates of specific events with Tesla's stock price movements, our goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that provide a deeper understanding of the market's reaction to these incidents.

## Ethical Considerations

In conducting this analysis, we are acutely aware of the ethical implications involved. The study navigates sensitive topics, including fatalities, and it is paramount that we approach this with the utmost respect and responsibility. Ethical considerations include:


#### Respect for Privacy:
Ensuring that personal details related to the incidents are treated with confidentiality and sensitivity.

#### Objectivity:
Maintaining an unbiased perspective and ensuring that our analysis does not unjustly influence public opinion about Tesla or affected individuals.

#### Data Integrity
Using data responsibly, ensuring its accuracy, and acknowledging any limitations or biases in our sources.

Our goal is to provide an analytical perspective without losing sight of the human element involved in these incidents.





## Conclusion

This project presents a unique intersection of data analysis, financial market dynamics, and societal impact. Through our exploration, we aim not only to understand the interplay between corporate events and stock performance but also to contribute thoughtfully to the discourse on automotive safety and technological advancement. Our findings have the potential to offer valuable insights into investor behavior, corporate responsibility, and public perception, particularly in the realm of cutting-edge technology and its implications.
