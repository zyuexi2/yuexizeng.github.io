## Introduction
Welcome to an insightful exploration at the crossroads of finance and technology, focusing on Tesla â€“ a company as renowned for its innovation as it is for its controversies. In this project, we delve into the nuanced relationship between Tesla's stock performance and incidents resulting in fatalities involving its vehicles. This study transcends academic boundaries, offering a real-world examination of how significant events tied to a high-profile company like Tesla can sway investor sentiment and shape market dynamics.






## Question
Tesla's role as a trailblazer in the high-tech and automotive industries makes it an ideal subject for this analysis. Our investigation centers on understanding the impact of reported fatalities in Tesla vehicles on the company's stock prices. This exploration aims to shed light on the stock market's reaction to news and events, particularly those that carry both technological and human interest elements.



## Data
The bedrock of our project is a thorough data collection process:

Stock Price Data: Leveraging financial databases and stock market APIs, we have extracted a detailed history of Tesla's stock prices. This dataset is pivotal, providing the framework to analyze stock price trends over time.

Death Data Collection: Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, we have access to crucial information about fatal Tesla incidents. This dataset encompasses the date, location, and model of each incident, along with crash descriptions, number of fatalities, and Autopilot usage. It offers a profound view into the frequency, geography, and potential safety risks associated with Tesla vehicles.

Data Integration: The core challenge and innovation of our study lie in marrying the stock data with the fatality event data. By aligning the dates of specific incidents with Tesla's stock price fluctuations, we aim to unveil patterns and correlations that provide deeper insights.

## Ethical Considerations

In conducting this analysis, we are acutely aware of the ethical implications involved. The study navigates sensitive topics, including fatalities, and it is paramount that we approach this with the utmost respect and responsibility. Ethical considerations include:

Respect for Privacy: Ensuring that personal details related to the incidents are treated with confidentiality and sensitivity.
Objectivity: Maintaining an unbiased perspective and ensuring that our analysis does not unjustly influence public opinion about Tesla or affected individuals.
Data Integrity: Using data responsibly, ensuring its accuracy, and acknowledging any limitations or biases in our sources.
Our goal is to provide an analytical perspective without losing sight of the human element involved in these incidents.




## Conclusion

This project presents a unique intersection of data analysis, financial market dynamics, and societal impact. Through our exploration, we aim not only to understand the interplay between corporate events and stock performance but also to contribute thoughtfully to the discourse on automotive safety and technological advancement. Our findings have the potential to offer valuable insights into investor behavior, corporate responsibility, and public perception, particularly in the realm of cutting-edge technology and its implications.
