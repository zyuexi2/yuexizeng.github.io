## Introduction
In the fast-paced world of electric vehicles, Tesla stands out as a beacon of innovation and ambition. Yet, with its rapid growth and technological advances come questions about safety and market performance. This blog post is the second installment in our journey to understand Tesla better, this time through the lens of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).



## The Data Tells a Story
Our EDA began with Tesla's fatality data. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, we meticulously analyzed each incident involving Tesla vehicles that led to fatalities. The data, detailed and sobering, provided not just statistics but also stories that needed to be told with sensitivity. We charted the number of deaths over time and across different countries, revealing patterns and raising questions about the factors contributing to these unfortunate events.

The next piece of the puzzle was Tesla's stock performance. Leveraging financial databases and APIs, we plotted the company's stock prices, capturing the highs and lows of Tesla's market journey. We observed the stock's volatility, its meteoric rises, and the dips that followed major incidents or announcements.

## Visual Insights


In our visual analysis, the first chart we looked at depicted the number of deaths against Tesla's stock closing prices (Image 1). While one might expect a high number of fatalities to correlate with a dip in stock prices, our initial observations did not reveal a direct correlation. This raised intriguing questions about market sentiment and the factors investors consider when valuing a company.

Next, we turned our attention to the distribution of fatalities by country (Image 2). The USA led by a significant margin, followed by China and Germany. This prompted a discussion on global safety standards, Tesla's autopilot usage, and the regulatory environment in different regions.

We also examined the number of fatalities over the years (Image 3). The data showed an increasing trend in recent years, which we cross-examined with Tesla's growing sales and expanded market presence.

Another angle we explored was the number of incidents by Tesla model (Image 4). This analysis offered a model-specific view, hinting at potential differences in safety by design or technology.


## The Subtleties of Correlation


##### Weak Positive Linear Relationship: 
This coefficient indicates a weak positive linear relationship between Tesla's stock price and the number of fatalities. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for the stock price and fatalities to increase together, albeit weakly.

##### Correlation â‰  Causation: 
A fundamental principle in data analysis is that correlation does not equate to causation. Therefore, while the stock prices and reported fatalities move together to a small extent, we cannot assert that one causes the other.

##### A Multitude of Influencing Factors: 
Tesla's stock price is subject to a vast array of factors ranging from market trends and investor sentiment to company performance and broader economic indicators. Similarly, the number of reported deaths is a multifaceted issue, influenced by numerous variables beyond the company's stock valuation.

##### Statistical Significance: 
The correlation coefficient by itself does not confirm if the relationship observed is statistically significant. To establish significance, additional testing, such as p-value analysis, is required.


In essence, the correlation coefficient revealed a slight positive relationship between the stock price and fatalities, yet this is a weak link and should be interpreted with caution. The stock market is a complex ecosystem, and Tesla's valuation is contingent upon a host of factors, just as the occurrence of fatalities has its independent determinants.






## Final Thoughts


As we conclude this phase of our data-driven exploration into Tesla's stock performance and reported fatalities, our journey has been as enlightening as it has been intricate. We've unearthed a tenuous connection between stock prices and safety incidents, a relationship that speaks to the multifaceted nature of market forces and public perception. 

Moving forward, our experience paves the way to investigate wider questions. For instance, how do similar correlations play out in other high-innovation industries? Could a comparative study across different companies reveal common patterns, or would it highlight the uniqueness of each firm's situation?
